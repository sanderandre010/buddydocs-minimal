# buddydocs-minimal (work)
Buddy Docs (BETA) app using basic frontend

## warning!!
this is a work branch, this will be used for any beta version, and coding everything directly. Most of the time many files aren't completed, or have something else wrong. If you want a better experience, **switch back to the main branch.**

## about me (not that important)

I am just a student in school, so my projects aren't that good :3
If you *somehow* manage to find this, which is very unlikely, please give me suggestions on what to add (if you want to) because I have no idea what to add without my brain exploding.

Buddy Docs (BETA) app using basic frontend

## last update
- finally added a github page! :D

## about me (not that important)

I am just a student in school, so my projects aren't that good :3
If you *somehow* manage to find this, which is very unlikely, please give me suggestions on what to add (if you want to) because I have no idea what to add without my brain exploding.
